code so that anyone can take it and adjust it according to their personal use.
We also host it for convenience for our friends (and anyone) who doesn't want to
deal with terminal.

You are free to modify it completely as is. Anyone who uses this code or products
coming off of it, for their kids, have to fully supervise the content and take
responsibility for the generated content. We do not take any responsibility about
the content.

Furthermore, we allow you to modify this code as you wish, and serve/host this
elsewhere as you wish, as long as you continue to take responsibility of your
modifications and usage, and keep it as free as possible for all families.

We reserve a right to ask you to take your version of the code down, if you used
this for bad reasons. We don't approve of political/religious/age-inappropriate/
audio-aggressive uses of this work.
